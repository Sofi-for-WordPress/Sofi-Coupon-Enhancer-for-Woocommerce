# Sofi Coupon Enhancer Plugin

The Sofi Coupon Enhancer Plugin is a powerful tool designed to enhance the functionality of your WordPress WooCommerce store. This plugin provides three key features to make managing coupons and orders more efficient and convenient.

## Features

### 1. List All Orders in Coupon Edit Page

With the Sofi Coupon Enhancer Plugin, you can easily view all the orders associated with a specific coupon right from the coupon edit page. This feature simplifies the process of tracking and managing orders related to your coupons, giving you quick access to essential information.

### 2. Automatic Coupon Usage Count Fix

Coupon usage counts can sometimes become incorrect, especially when coupons are duplicated from different sources. Our plugin automatically fixes this issue by recalculating and updating the coupon usage count, ensuring accurate tracking of coupon usage on your WooCommerce store.

### 3. Add a New Column to Order Shop Table

The Sofi Coupon Enhancer Plugin also enhances your order management capabilities by adding a new column to the order shop table. This column displays the coupons used for each order, making it easier for you to identify and keep track of the coupons applied to various orders.
